# Calculus unraveled: Intuition, Proofs, and Python

## Hello friends!

Here's the repo for my shiny new calculus textbook. It's 605 pages of wholesome mathematical goodness :)

This repository contains all the Python code files to produce the book figures, illustrate the concepts, and show solutions to all exercises.

### Table of contents and sample chapters

You can see the table of contents via the amazon book preview (link below) or the TOC_and_ch1.pdf file uploaded here. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the book, target audience, and prerequisites.

Please enjoy the sample chapter on fundamentals of differentiation (ch5.pdf). Looking through this chapter will give you a feel for the quality, formatting, and style of the book and the exercises.
